## Basic

web - pages have 3 parts

envelope (header, footer, sometimes side-bar)
main-spot/web (html of the main part)
components (reuseable html-parts/templates)

-> main spot 
    -> get components
      -> get more components
    -> put all into envelope
      -> get even more components
    ->echo the page

done. easy quick :P
