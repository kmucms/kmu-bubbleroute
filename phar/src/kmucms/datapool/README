DataPool

Basic idea is to create items description. 
Then derive other tasks from the description like manage items, edit items.
An item can be a product, an event, a page, a news, an address, ... .

items description
  => create db tables
  => create items overview
  => create item edit 
  => create frontendviews (for people who should not edit the items)
